# SphynxBot
This a discord bot that takes data from a database in google firebase 
Then this data is then used to rank players using the 'trueskill' library
The bot is also able to display the leaderboards and modify data in the google firebase

I discontinued making this bot because it's purpose was not needed and I had a growing schedule and things to deal with.
